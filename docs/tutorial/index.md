# Quick Start Tutorial

This will take you through setting up a GoCardless test account, setting
this up in CiviCRM, and making your first test contribution. It is easy to
set up a sandbox account and much better to do this than to use a real
account for testing/learning.

**After completing the tutorial you can pretty much follow it through
again for a live account.**
